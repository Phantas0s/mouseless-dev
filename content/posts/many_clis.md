Today is the first day for THE challenge.

In May, I'll give you a CLI each day. I'll try to make it neat for every living soul. I like hard mode, even when I lose.

Help me carving history with some shell madness. Gimme your tricks for each CLI to spread love in the Universe. ðŸ’•ðŸ§µ

## Alias - 2021-05-01

$> alias [name]="[command]"

An alias can represent a particular command, often defining a short name for a long, complicated command. It can also run a command with specific options.

[01/31]

```
# Create the files for the demo
$> touch super_file_1 super_file_2 super_file_3

# Delete a file without confirmation
$> rm super_file_1

# Create an alias to always delete files with confirmation
$> alias rm="rm -i"

# Delete a file with confirmation
$> rm super_file_2
rm: remove regular empty file 'super_file_2'? y

# Ignore the alias using a slash \ (default behavior of rm)
$> \rm super_file_3
```

## nl - 2021-05-02

$> nl [input]

Number Lines of an input which can be a file, as often.

[02/31]

```
# Look at my cool file
$> cat nl_number_line
This is a line

Great Scott! This is a line too

# Number lines
$> nl nl_number_line
     1  This is a line

     2  Great Scott! This is a line too

# Option `-b` (`b`ody numbering) with style

## Style `a` to number `a`ll lines 
$> nl -b a nl_number_line
     1  This is a line
     2
     3  Great Scott! This is a line too

## Style `p` to number lines only when it matches a regex
$> nl -b p'Scott.*' nl_number_line
       This is a line

     1  Great Scott! This is a line too

# Option `-i` (line `i`ncrement)
$> nl -i 10 -b a nl_number_line
     1  This is a line
    11
    21  Great Scott! This is a line too
```

## sort - 2021-05-03

$> sort [input]

Sort lines of the input which can be a file. How surprising!

[03/31]

```
$> cat sort_that
korn_or_corn      800  2018-02-04
guide_to_seashell 3000 2021-01-01

# Option -k sort via `k`ey (field)
$> sort -k 3 sort_that

how_to_terminal   200  2019-12-25
guide_to_seashell 3000 2021-01-01

# Option -n do a `n`umeric sort:
$> sort -n -k 2 sort_that
how_to_terminal   200  2019-12-25
korn_or_corn      800  2018-02-04
guide_to_seashell 3000 2021-01-01

## Without `-n`
$> sort -k 2 sort_that
how_to_terminal   200  2019-12-25

```

## uniq - 2021-05-04 (AFTER SORT)
