            Vim was too complicated. It wasn't worth the effort to learn it. Or so I thought.
        </p>
        <p>
            I tried anyway.
        </p>
        <p>
            I could write and edit my content after a couple of hours. Why everybody thought it was so hard?
        </p>
        <p>
            Even better: I was more productive, I could focus solely on what I was writing, and I had so much fun!
        </p>
        <p>
            The fun never stopped. Even after playing with Vim for many years.

    <h2>FAQ</h2>
    <section id="faq">
        <h3>Why should I learn Vim?</h3>
        <ul>

            <li>You can configure IDE-like features (autocompletion, jump to definition, debugging...) for many programming languages.
                <br />No need to have multiple editors or IDEs anymore!</li>
            <li>Vim allows you to write and edit using only the keyboard, improving your efficiency.</li>
            <li>Switching between keyboard and mouse lower your cognitive energy and breaks your flow.</li>
            <li>There are countless Vim plugins out there, allowing a more modern experience, similar to an IDE.</li>
            <li>You can use any shell command directly in Vim, expanding drastically its functionalities.</li>
            <li>Many command-line tools out there use the same keystrokes as Vim.</li>
            <li>You can use Vim keystrokes for writing and editing command lines in popular shells, like Bash or Zsh.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Is it true that Vim has a steep learning curve?</h3>
        <p>Despite its reputation, Vim is not hard to learn. It works differently than most editor or IDE out there, <br \>requiring some adaptation, but you can learn the basics in a couple of hours.</p>
        <p>Vim is a good example of a tool easy to learn but hard to master: you'll add new functionalities to your workflow overtime, <br />improving your editing experience and your efficiency.</p>
        <p>That's why the book Learning to Play Vim takes a step-by-step approach. It can also be useful as a reference.</p>
        <h3>There are many resources about Vim out there: what's different with this one?</h3>
        <p>Learning to Play Vim takes a step-by-step approach:
            <ol>
                <li>First, you'll see the most important principles to be able to use Vim as quickly as possible.</li>
                <li>Each subsequent chapter build on the previous one, to show you more advanced techniques.</li>
                <li>Some chapters will go deeper into one specific subject (like search or building your IDE).</li>
            </ol>
            <p>Additionally, the book is aimed to be as complete as possible without going into useless, boring details. <br />It's aimed to be practical, for you to get as much value as possible.</p>
        <p>It's also designed to be fun to read with a minimum of fluff. I don't want to tell you the story of my grandmother for 19209 pages.</p>
