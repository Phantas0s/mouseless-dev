            Vim was too complicated. It wasn't worth the effort to learn it. Or so I thought.
        </p>
        <p>
            I tried anyway.
        </p>
        <p>
            I could write and edit my content in a couple of hours. Why everybody thought it was so hard?
        </p>
        <p>
            Even better: I had so much fun using it!
        </p>
        <p>
            The fun never stopped, even after playing with Vim for over a decade!
