                Years ago, I was mentored to build a <strong>personalized</strong>, <strong>scalable</strong>, and <strong>mouseless</strong> development environment.

        <div class="block">
            <p>Your Mouseless Development Environment will include these tools:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong><a href="https://www.archlinux.org/" target="_blank" title="Arch Linux">Arch Linux</a></strong></li>
                <li><strong><a href="http://zsh.sourceforge.net/" target="_blank" title="Zsh">Zsh</a></strong></li>
                <li><strong><a href="https://i3wm.org/" target="_blank" title="i3wm">i3 window manager</a></strong></li>

            </ul>
            <p>You don't like some of them? No problem! You can replace Vim by your IDE, or Arch Linux by Ubuntu. <strong>I show you the "how" and you decide the "what".</strong></p>
            <p>A mouseless environment is often centered around the Linux shell. If you don't use a shell often, that's fine too. You'll learn step by step.</p>
