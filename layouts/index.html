                Have you ever thought to increase your efficiency<br />
                by using <strong>less your mouse</strong> and <strong>more your keyboard?</strong>
            </p>

            <p>
                I surely didn't!
            </p>

            </p>
                Thanksfully, good friends taught me how to create <br />
                a <strong>personalized</strong>, <strong>scalable</strong>, and <strong>mouseless</strong> development environment.
            </p>

            <p class="size-l opposite">Now, I could never come back.</p>

            <p>
                Not everybody has the chance to be mentored to create such development environment. That's why I would love to transmit what they taught me, and more.
            </p>
            <p>
                The goal? <strong>Increasing your productivity</strong> and make your coding experience <strong>more rewarding,</strong> and <strong>more fun!</strong>
