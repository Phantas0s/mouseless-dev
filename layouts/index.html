                Years ago, I was mentored to build a <strong>personalized</strong>, <strong>scalable</strong>, and <strong>mouseless</strong> development environment.

                It redirects the brain power we use to juggle input devices and focus it where it belongs: on the things we create.

            <p class="toggled-element">For years, I have been working back and forth on macOS and Gnome based Linux (mostly Ubuntu), but I always have been curious about using a window manager like i3. My problem was that I had no idea where to start and like many people, I lacked the time to search for good tutorials. Then I saw a post on Reddit by Matthieu asking people to please check out his new book, a book about exactly what I have been wanting, a book about i3 and other mouseless tools! Let me tell you that it does exactly what it says on the cover, it will change the way you work for the better. I have now been running Arch and i3 exclusively and I have never been as productive behind my keyboard. The book is also a great introduction to Vim and Tmux, which I have been using for years, but Matthieu still managed to teach me a few things about it.</p>
            I highly recommend this book to every software developer; get it, read it and get sh*t done by being a lot more productive.

            <p>You don't like some of them? No problem! You can replace Vim by your IDE, or Arch Linux by Ubuntu. <strong>I show you the "how" and you decide the "what".</strong></p>
            <p>A mouseless environment is often centered around the Linux shell. If you don't use a shell often, that's fine too. You'll learn step by step.</p>
