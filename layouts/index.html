                Years ago, I was mentored to build a <strong>personalized</strong>, <strong>scalable</strong>, and <strong>mouseless</strong> development environment.
            </p>
            <p>
                I discovered that it takes <strong>less cognitive energy</strong> to keep my hands on the keyboard without the need to grab the mouse all the time.
            </p>
            <p>
                By writing this book, I would like to show you everything I learned.

            <p class="toggled-element">For years, I have been working back and forth on macOS and Gnome based Linux (mostly Ubuntu), but I always have been curious about using a window manager like i3. My problem was that I had no idea where to start and like many people, I lacked the time to search for good tutorials. Then I saw a post on Reddit by Matthieu asking people to please check out his new book, a book about exactly what I have been wanting, a book about i3 and other mouseless tools! Let me tell you that it does exactly what it says on the cover, it will change the way you work for the better. I have now been running Arch and i3 exclusively and I have never been as productive behind my keyboard. The book is also a great introduction to Vim and Tmux, which I have been using for years, but Matthieu still managed to teach me a few things about it.</p>
            I highly recommend this book to every software developer; get it, read it and get sh*t done by being a lot more productive.

            <p>You don't like some of them? No problem! You can replace Vim by your IDE, or Arch Linux by Ubuntu. <strong>I show you the "how" and you decide the "what".</strong></p>
            <p>A mouseless environment is often centered around the Linux shell. If you don't use a shell often, that's fine too. You'll learn step by step.</p>

    <h2>FAQ</h2>
    <section id="faq">
        <h3>What if I don't want to use Arch Linux?</h3>
        <p>I choose Arch Linux because it can teach you a great deal about Linux systems in general.<br \>
        If you want to keep your current OS, I recommend you to follow the book with a virtual machine (using Virtualbox for example) to get the most out of it.</p>
        <p>You have then two options:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>You can use the installation scripts to automatically install everything on a new computer.</li>
            <li>You can pick the tools you want and use them with another Linux distro, or even with macOS (except i3).</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Why not learning all the keystrokes from the software I already use?</h3>
        <p>For three reasons:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>The keystrokes across software are inconsistent and difficult to remember. You can't always change them either.</li>
            <li>It's tedious to re-configure manually your keystrokes for every software each time you install your system. I automated all of that.</li>
            <li>The tools described in the book are <i>especially designed</i> for the keyboard.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>The book proposes a set of <i>consistent keystrokes</i> across tools which fit very well together. They can easily interact with the shell too, making them really powerful.</p>
        <h3>I don't know how to use the Linux shell. Is it a problem?</h3>
        <p>Not at all! If you're motivated, you'll learn a lot from this book. Guaranteed!</p>
